# OGame Empty Planet Finder
A little bot for the browser game [OGame](https://gameforge.com/de-DE/play/ogame).  
I made it 2013 and it received last update in 2019, so it's probably outdated.  
The basic idea behind the tool was to help the player to find empty planets to colonise, since back in 2013 a lot of people played the game and best slots were taken very fast.
